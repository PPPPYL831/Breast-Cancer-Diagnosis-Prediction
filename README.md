This project aims to classify benign and malignant tumors with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, assisting physicians in diagnosis. The dataset is from Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, including 569 samples with 32 attributes each. We try to develop an algorithm that can classify benign and malignant tumors based on the patient's physical condition, pathological characteristics of the tumor.
